Overview

Over the next three months, this project will analyze Premier League match data to predict whether a team will win, lose, or draw based on key statistics. Using machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify the most influential factors affecting match outcomes. The project will involve data collection, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.

Motivation

As a long-time follower of the Premier League, I have always been fascinated by the physicality, relentless tempo, and moments of brilliance that define football matches. By combining my passion for the game with my data science expertise, I aim to develop a match-winner finder model. This model will identify key players who have a decisive impact on match results by analyzing key performance metrics and uncovering patterns that distinguish game-changers from the rest. This project seeks to merge the excitement of football with the precision of data analytics.

Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze key statistics that significantly impact match outcomes. This involves:

Identifying and refining key performance metrics.

Adjusting their weighting to accurately assess their impact on match results.

Building a predictive model that effectively forecasts match outcomes based on historical and contextual data.

Dataset

To improve predictive accuracy and capture the broader context influencing match outcomes, the project will incorporate:

Match statistics: Goals, expected goals (xG), assists, expected assists (xA), shots, possession, pass completion, defensive actions, etc.

Recent form: Team performance trends over the last few matches.

Injuries and key players: How missing or standout players impact team performance.

New transfers: Influence of new players joining teams mid-season.

Cumulative team statistics: Overall squad depth, average team ratings, and historical performance trends.

Data Sources:

FBref / Opta Statistics: Comprehensive match statistics, player performance data, and historical records.

Similar platforms: Additional sources for recent form graphics, team values, and other contextual football analytics.

Analysis Approach

1. Data Collection & Cleaning

Gather data from FBref, Opta Statistics, and other reliable football analytics platforms.

Incorporate match statistics, team performance trends, injuries, transfers, and cumulative team statistics.

Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify correlations between various statistics and match outcomes.

Analyze trends in team performances over time.

Investigate the impact of factors like home advantage, injuries, and player transfers on match results.

3. Feature Engineering

Compute rolling averages for key statistics (xG, xA, goal contributions, defensive actions) over the last 3/8 matches to capture form trends.

Adjust for opposition strength to ensure fair weighting of performance metrics.

Develop impact ratings for key players based on form, influence, and clutch performances.

Model injuries and new signings to dynamically adjust team strength.

4. Predictive Modeling

Train machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost to analyze match outcomes.

Identify the most influential features impacting game results.

Evaluate model performance by comparing predicted outcomes with actual match results and refining the model accordingly.

Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no meaningful relationship between different match-related factors and game outcomes. Variations in these factors do not significantly impact a team’s chances of winning or losing.

Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): Certain match-related factors have a significant influence on game outcomes. Changes in these factors are directly associated with fluctuations in a team's probability of winning.

Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, the goal is to:

Develop a data-driven model that accurately predicts Premier League match outcomes.

Identify the most important statistics that drive match results.

Provide insights into how different factors (form, injuries, player impact) influence a team's chances of winning.

Tools & Technologies
