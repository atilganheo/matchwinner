# Premier League Match Winner - DSA210 Project
---
## Project Overview
Over the next three months, this project will analyze Premier League match data to predict whether a team will win, lose, or draw based on key statistics. Using machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify the most influential factors affecting match outcomes. The project will involve data collection, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.

## Motivation

As a long-time follower of the Premier League, I have always been fascinated by the physicality, relentless tempo, and moments of brilliance that define football matches. By combining my passion for the game with my data science expertise, I aim to develop a match-winner finder model. This model will identify key players who have a decisive impact on match results by analyzing key performance metrics and uncovering patterns that distinguish game-changers from the rest. This project seeks to merge the excitement of football with the precision of data analytics.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze key statistics that significantly impact match outcomes. This involves:

- Identifying and refining key performance metrics.

- Adjusting their weighting to accurately assess their impact on match results.

- Building a predictive model that effectively forecasts match outcomes based on historical and contextual data.

---
## Dataset

To improve predictive accuracy and capture the broader context influencing match outcomes, the project will incorporate:

- Match statistics: Goals, expected goals (xG), assists, expected assists (xA), shots, possession, pass completion, defensive actions, etc.

- Recent form: Team performance trends over the last few matches.

- Injuries and key players: How missing or standout players impact team performance.

- New transfers: Influence of new players joining teams mid-season.

- Cumulative team statistics: Overall squad depth, average team ratings, and historical performance trends.

---
## Data Sources:

FBref / Opta Statistics: Comprehensive match statistics, player performance data, and historical records.

Similar platforms: Additional sources for recent form graphics, team values, and other contextual football analytics.

### Analysis Approach
#### Data Collection & Cleaning
- Gather data from FBref, Opta, and other reliable sources.
- Include match stats, team trends, injuries, and transfers.
- Clean and preprocess data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Identify correlations between key stats and match outcomes.
- Analyze team performance trends over time.
- Assess the impact of home advantage, injuries, and transfers.
- Feature Engineering

### Compute rolling averages for key metrics (xG, xA, goal contributions, etc.).
- Adjust for opposition strength and develop player impact ratings.
- Model injuries and transfers to refine team strength estimates.

### Predictive Modeling

- Train ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict match results.
- Identify key factors influencing outcomes.
- Evaluate and refine model performance based on predictions vs. actual results

## Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no meaningful relationship between different match-related factors and game outcomes. Variations in these factors do not significantly impact a team’s chances of winning or losing.

Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): Certain match-related factors have a significant influence on game outcomes. Changes in these factors are directly associated with fluctuations in a team's probability of winning.

---
## Example Analysis
To illustrate, I’ll create a scatter plot showing the relationship between a team's expected goals (xG) and the expected goals against (xGA) of their opponent. A team that consistently outperforms its xG while limiting opponents to lower xGA may indicate strong attacking efficiency and defensive solidity, whereas teams that underperform in both areas might struggle to convert chances and prevent quality opportunities.

Additionally, I’ll analyze xG to scoring ratio to identify teams that maximize their goal-scoring opportunities. If a high xG doesn’t translate into actual goals, it may point to inefficiencies in attack. On the defensive side, comparing xGA to actual goals conceded will help assess whether a team is overperforming defensively or conceding more than expected.

These are just a few examples of the types of analysis that will be conducted. Many other factors, such as progressive passes, total running distance, and possession percentages, will also be explored to refine the model and improve match outcome predictions.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, I aim to answer the following questions:

- Can match winners be consistently predicted in a low-scoring sport like football?
- Which key metrics—such as xG, xGA, possession, or passing efficiency—are the most reliable indicators of match results?
- How do attacking and defensive statistics combine to determine the probability of a team winning?
